Repo for students to practice commits &amp; forking

1) Editing pages within a team \
    a) Trainer to collect students github IDs (Google doc?) and add them as collaborators
       We can then simulate editting documents as a team. \
    b) Trainer shows students how to clone this repo so they have their own personal copy to \
   share with other students (using google doc list) \
2) Trainer REMOVES students from collaborators and then we can simulate
external authors by forking this repository
